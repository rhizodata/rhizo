## Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time | Space | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|-------|
| Write chunk | O(n) | O(n) | n = data size |
| Read chunk | O(n) | O(n) | Direct path lookup |
| Check exists | O(1) | O(1) | Hash to path |
| Time travel query | O(1) | O(1) | Direct version lookup, no log replay |
| Commit version | O(k) | O(k) | k = chunk count |
| Create branch | O(t) | O(t) | t = table count, zero data copy |
| Cross-table commit | O(t) | O(t) | t = tables in transaction |

Operations are constant with respect to total stored data. A 1PB system performs identically to a 1GB system for individual operations.

## Storage Deduplication

For a dataset with original size $S$, $V$ versions, and change rate $r$ per version:

**Naive storage:**
$$S_{naive} = S \times V$$

**Deduplicated storage:**
$$S_{dedup} = S \times (1 + (V-1) \times r)$$

**Savings:**
$$\text{Savings} = 1 - \frac{1 + (V-1) \times r}{V}$$

### Theoretical Example

30 versions, 5% daily change:

$$S_{dedup} = S \times (1 + 29 \times 0.05) = 2.45S$$

$$\text{Savings} = 1 - \frac{2.45}{30} = 91.8\%$$

### Measured Results (Merkle Tree Implementation)

**Implementation Status:** COMPLETE (January 2026)

| Change % | Theoretical Reuse | Measured Reuse | Match |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| 1% | 99% | 98.8% | Yes |
| 5% | 95% | 95.0% | Exact |
| 10% | 90% | 90.0% | Exact |
| 25% | 75% | 75.0% | Exact |

**O(change) storage confirmed.** Only changed chunks are stored, not full copies.

**Implementation:**
- Rust: `rhizo_core/src/merkle/` (build_tree, diff_trees, verify_tree)
- Python: `merkle_build_tree()`, `merkle_diff_trees()`, `merkle_verify_tree()`
- Benchmark: `examples/merkle_benchmark.py`

Content-defined chunking efficiency validated by Xia et al. [1].

## Collision Probability

BLAKE3 produces 256-bit hashes. Collision probability follows the birthday bound [2]:

$$P(\text{collision}) \approx \frac{n^2}{2^{b+1}}$$

For $10^{15}$ chunks (exabyte scale):

$$P(\text{collision}) = \frac{10^{30}}{2^{257}} \approx 4.3 \times 10^{-48}$$

For comparison: undetected RAM bit flips occur at ~$10^{-13}$ per year [3]. Hash collision is not a practical concern.

```python
n = 10**15  # chunks
b = 256     # bits
p = (n ** 2) / (2 ** (b + 1))
# 4.31e-48
```

---

## Snapshot Isolation

Rhizo implements snapshot isolation, the same model used by PostgreSQL and Oracle [4].

**Properties:**
1. All reads within a transaction see the same snapshot
2. Uncommitted changes are invisible to other transactions
3. Concurrent writes to the same table are detected and one is aborted

**Conflict condition** for transactions $T_i$ and $T_j$:

$$\text{Conflict}(T_i, T_j) = (W_i \cap W_j \neq \emptyset) \land (\text{concurrent})$$

This is table-level conflict detection. Row-level detection is a future enhancement.

### Defense-in-Depth: 3-Layer Conflict Protection

Rhizo uses three independent mechanisms to detect conflicts, ensuring safety even under edge cases:

| Layer | Mechanism | What It Catches |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **1. check_conflicts** | Compares against `recent_committed` list | Early detection of overlapping writes |
| **2. validate_snapshot** | Verifies read snapshot hasn't changed | Tables modified since transaction start |
| **3. Catalog version enforcement** | Rejects out-of-sequence versions | Ultimate safety net, prevents duplicate commits |

Even if Layer 1 is cleared (e.g., at epoch boundaries), Layers 2 and 3 still catch conflicts. This defense-in-depth approach was verified by testing conflict detection after clearing `recent_committed`.

### Recovery Correctness

The commit order is: **Apply effects → Persist committed status**

This "write-ahead" pattern ensures:
- Effects are durable before marking committed
- No replay needed during recovery (effects already applied)
- Crash before commit marker = transaction appears failed, but data may exist safely

---

## Cache Correctness

Content-addressed storage enables **invalidation-free caching** with mathematical guarantees.

**Theorem:** If `hash(data) = h`, then any future request for hash `h` returns identical data.

**Proof:** Content addressing means the hash IS the identifier. The same hash always identifies the same content. Unlike pointer-based addressing, there is no indirection that could change.

**Implications:**
- Cached Arrow RecordBatches never need invalidation
- Cache shared across tables (same data = same hash)
- Cache shared across versions (unchanged chunks = same hash)
- Cache shared across branches (branched data = same hash until modified)

**Hit rate model:**
$$P(\text{hit}) = P(\text{repeat}) + P(\text{shared}) \times P(\text{overlap})$$

Where `P(repeat)` is probability of re-reading same chunk, `P(shared)` is probability of cross-table/version/branch sharing, and `P(overlap)` is probability of reading shared data.

Measured hit rates: **91%+** for typical workloads, **97%+** with time travel queries.

---

## Parallel Speedup

Amdahl's Law for serial fraction $s$:

$$\text{Speedup}(N) = \frac{1}{s + \frac{1-s}{N}}$$

$$\text{Speedup}_{max} = \frac{1}{s}$$

With 20% serial work, maximum speedup is 5x regardless of parallelism. Reducing serial fraction through better architecture beats adding workers.

---

## Energy Model

### Storage Energy

Storage energy consumption:

$$E = C \times P_{base} \times PUE \times T$$

Where $C$ = capacity, $P_{base}$ = watts/TB, $PUE$ = power usage effectiveness, $T$ = time.

If deduplication reduces storage by factor $D$:

$$E_{saved} = E_{baseline} \times (1 - \frac{1}{D})$$

At 75% deduplication ($D=4$), energy consumption drops 75%.

### Transaction Energy (Coordination-Free)

**Implementation Status:** COMPLETE (January 2026)

Transaction energy follows time:

$$E_{tx} = P_{cpu} \times t_{tx} + P_{network} \times t_{network} + P_{idle} \times t_{wait}$$

For consensus-based transactions ($t_{consensus} \approx 100ms$):

$$E_{consensus} = P_{cpu} \times 0.1s + P_{network} \times 0.3s + P_{idle} \times 0.08s$$

For coordination-free transactions ($t_{local} \approx 0.022ms$):

$$E_{cf} = P_{cpu} \times 0.000022s$$

Network and idle terms are **zero** — no round-trips, no waiting for quorum.

**Measured Results (CodeCarbon):**

| Metric | Rhizo | Consensus Baseline | Ratio |
|--------|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Energy per tx | 2.2e-11 kWh | 2.1e-6 kWh | **97,943x less** |
| CO2 per tx | 8.0e-12 kg | 7.9e-7 kg | **97,943x less** |

**Annual projections (1M tx/day):**

$$E_{saved} = 365 \times 10^6 \times (E_{consensus} - E_{cf}) \approx 730 \text{ kWh/year}$$

Equivalent to 292 kg CO2/year or 14 trees planted.

**Implementation:** `benchmarks/energy_benchmark.py`, `sandbox/coordination_free/proofs/energy_efficiency_proof.md`

**Empirical Validation:** The theoretical model above uses simulated consensus delays (100ms) to establish baselines. For empirical validation against real systems (SQLite WAL, Redis, etcd), see `benchmarks/real_consensus_benchmark.py`. Measured speedups of 30-93,000x confirm the mathematical predictions across different baseline systems.

Global data center electricity: 200-250 TWh/year [5]. Storage is ~15%. Deduplication and coordination-free transactions at scale have measurable impact.

## Algebraic Classification for Conflict-Free Merge

**Implementation Status:** COMPLETE (v0.4.0 - January 2026)

Operations can be classified by algebraic properties that enable automatic conflict-free merging.

### Semilattice Operations

A join-semilattice satisfies:
- **Associative**: $(a \sqcup b) \sqcup c = a \sqcup (b \sqcup c)$
- **Commutative**: $a \sqcup b = b \sqcup a$
- **Idempotent**: $a \sqcup a = a$

**Examples:** MAX, MIN, UNION, INTERSECT

**Confluence Theorem:** If all operations on a value form a semilattice, the final state is independent of operation order.

### Abelian Group Operations

An Abelian group satisfies:
- **Associative**: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
- **Commutative**: $a + b = b + a$
- **Identity**: $a + 0 = a$
- **Inverse**: $a + (-a) = 0$

**Examples:** ADD (counters), MULTIPLY (scaling factors)

**Merge Theorem:** Concurrent Abelian operations merge by applying the group operation: $merge(O_1, O_2) = O_1.value + O_2.value$

### Classification Decision

```
Op ∈ Semilattice?   → Conflict-free (merge via ⊔)
Op ∈ Abelian Group? → Conflict-free (merge via +)
Op is Generic?      → Requires coordination
```

### Performance Results

| Operation Type | Throughput | Merge Success Rate |
|----------------|------------|--------------------|
| ADD (Abelian) | 4,398 K ops/sec | 100% |
| MAX (Semilattice) | 4,483 K ops/sec | 100% |
| UNION (Semilattice) | 745 K ops/sec | 100% |
| Schema lookup | 11,825 K ops/sec | N/A |
| OVERWRITE (Generic) | N/A | Conflict detected |

**Implementation:**
- Rust: `rhizo_core::algebraic` (OpType, AlgebraicValue, AlgebraicMerger)
- Python: `PyOpType`, `PyAlgebraicValue`, `algebraic_merge()`
- Tests: 632 tests covering all operation types and mathematical properties

## Coordination-Free Distributed Transactions

**Implementation Status:** COMPLETE (January 2026)

Building on algebraic classification, Rhizo achieves distributed transactions without consensus for algebraic operations.

### Theoretical Foundation

**Theorem (Convergence):** If all operations in a distributed system are algebraic (commutative + associative), all replicas converge to the same state regardless of message ordering.

**Proof sketch:** Let $O = \{o_1, o_2, ..., o_n\}$ be concurrent operations. By commutativity, any permutation yields the same result. By associativity, any grouping yields the same result. Therefore, all replicas applying $O$ in any order converge to the same final state. $\square$

**Corollary:** Algebraic transactions can commit locally without coordination.

### Causality Tracking

Vector clocks track happened-before relationships:

$$V_a < V_b \iff \forall i: V_a[i] \leq V_b[i] \land \exists j: V_a[j] < V_b[j]$$

$$V_a \| V_b \iff \neg(V_a < V_b) \land \neg(V_b < V_a)$$

When $V_a \| V_b$ (concurrent), algebraic merge resolves automatically.

### Performance Results

| Metric | Rhizo | Consensus Baseline | Improvement |
|--------|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Local commit latency | 0.022 ms | 100 ms | **31,000x faster** |
| Throughput (2 nodes) | 255,297 ops/sec | ~1,000 ops/sec | **255x higher** |
| Convergence rounds | 3 (constant) | N/A | Guaranteed |

**Key finding:** Convergence rounds are constant regardless of operation count due to algebraic properties.

### Mathematical Soundness (Verified)

| Property | Formula | Verified |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Commutativity | $merge(A,B) = merge(B,A)$ | Yes |
| Associativity | $merge(merge(A,B),C) = merge(A,merge(B,C))$ | Yes |
| Idempotency | $merge(A,A) = A$ | Yes (semilattice ops) |
| Convergence | All nodes reach identical state | Yes |

**Implementation:** `rhizo_core::distributed`, `benchmarks/distributed_benchmark.py`, `sandbox/coordination_free/proofs/`
