# Coordination Bounds: Open Questions

This document tracks open research questions arising from the coordination bounds work.

---

## Key Findings & Implications

### Empirical Results (Phase 16)
- **92% of TPC-C (OLTP) workload is coordination-free**
- **1,509x speedup** for coordination-free vs coordination-required operations
- **$16.5B/year** recoverable waste (92% of $18B global coordination cost)

### Core Insight
**Coordination cost is a property of OPERATIONS, not systems.**

```
Traditional view:  "Distributed systems need consensus"
Our finding:       "Only non-commutative operations need consensus"
```

### The Coordination-Algebra Correspondence
```
Commutative operations     →  C = 0 (instant, no coordination)
Non-commutative operations →  C = Ω(log N) (unavoidable minimum)
```

### Implications
1. **Economic**: Most distributed compute is unnecessary coordination overhead
2. **Architectural**: Systems should classify operations by algebra, not assume coordination
3. **Theoretical**: This may be a fundamental physical law, not just a CS result

## Critical Question: Is This a Physical Law?

### Q0: Fundamental Law Hypothesis
**Status**: Open - HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Importance**: Critical++

**Hypothesis**: Coordination bounds are a FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL LAW governing information reconciliation across space.

Just as:
- Speed of light limits information transfer
- Heisenberg limits measurement precision
- Landauer limits computation energy
- Carnot limits thermodynamic efficiency

Coordination bounds may limit **agreement across space**.

**Evidence needed**:
- [ ] Quantum systems obey bounds (or explain why not)
- [ ] Biological systems achieve bounds (evolution as optimizer)
- [ ] Economic systems exhibit bounds (market coordination)
- [ ] Physical derivation from information theory

**If true**: This is not a computer science result. It's physics.

## Foundational Questions

### Q1: The Coordination-Complexity Hierarchy
**Status**: Open
**Importance**: Critical

Is the gap between C=0 and C=Omega(log N) actually a cliff, or is there a spectrum?

**Sub-questions**:
- Can we define "degree of commutativity" for operations?
- Are there operations with C = O(1) but C != 0?
- Is there a hierarchy like P/NP but for coordination?

**Potential approach**: Define commutativity defect d(f) = fraction of input pairs where f(a,b) != f(b,a). Study C(f) as function of d(f).

### Q2: Quantum Coordination Bounds
**Status**: Open
**Importance**: High

Do quantum effects (entanglement, superposition) allow breaking classical coordination bounds?

**Sub-questions**:
- Can entanglement provide "free" agreement?
- What is the quantum analog of consensus?
- Does quantum teleportation affect coordination cost?

**Relevant literature**: Quantum consensus protocols, quantum Byzantine agreement

### Q3: Biological Coordination
**Status**: Open
**Importance**: High

Do biological systems (cells, neural networks, ecosystems) achieve optimal coordination bounds?

**Sub-questions**:
- Is cell signaling coordination-free where possible?
- Do neural networks use algebraic aggregation?
- Has evolution discovered these bounds?

**Potential approach**: Analyze biological consensus mechanisms (quorum sensing, neural voting) for algebraic structure.

### Q4: Coordination Thermodynamics
**Status**: Open
**Importance**: Medium

Is there a thermodynamic cost to coordination beyond computation?

**Sub-questions**:
- Does Landauer's principle apply to agreement?
- Is there a minimum energy per bit of consensus?
- Can we define "coordination entropy"?

**Connection**: We showed coordination = waiting = wasted energy. But is there a fundamental lower bound?

## Technical Questions

### Q5: Automatic Commutativity Detection
**Status**: Partially addressed (Phase 14)
**Importance**: Critical

Can we automatically detect if an arbitrary function is commutative?

**Sub-questions**:
- Is commutativity detection decidable in general?
- What about restricted languages (SQL, dataflow)?
- Can we use SMT solvers for verification?

**Current approach**: Pattern matching + known signatures. Need: symbolic analysis.

### Q6: Lifting Completeness
**Status**: Open

**Conjecture**: Any operation with bounded conflict rate is liftable.
