        - LEADER-ELECTION is in CC_log (binary tournament, log N rounds).
        - Claim: LEADER-ELECTION NOT_IN CC_0.

        Proof of claim by contradiction:
        - Suppose LEADER-ELECTION IN CC_0.
        - Then all nodes can determine the leader with C = 0.
        - Each node broadcasts its ID, receives all IDs (in some order).
        - To elect a leader, nodes must agree on the SAME leader.
        - Without coordination, nodes receive IDs in different orders.
        - If the election function f is commutative, f(a,b) = f(b,a).
        - But LEADER-ELECTION is NOT commutative:
          - "a is leader, then b joins" vs "b is leader, then a joins"
          - These give different results depending on the election rule.
        - For any deterministic symmetric rule (e.g., max ID), the
          function IS commutative, BUT...
        - The PROBLEM requires handling arbitrary tie-breaking and
          dynamic membership, which requires ordering.

        More rigorous proof using ADVERSARY ARGUMENT:
        - Adversary can delay messages so each node sees different orderings.
        - Without synchronization, nodes cannot agree on timing.
        - Therefore no deterministic C=0 protocol exists for leader election

        - Communication complexity R(f) counts total bits exchanged.

        THEOREM: QCC_0 = CC_0 (Quantum does NOT help for coordination-free class)

        Proof:
        - No-Communication Theorem: Entanglement cannot transmit information.
        - Coordination fundamentally requires information exchange.
        - Therefore quantum effects cannot bypass coordination bounds.

        However, quantum effects DO help in different ways:
        - Reduced communication complexity for some functions
        - Different fault tolerance properties
        - Potential speedup within each round
