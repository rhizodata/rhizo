## The Derivation Chain

### Step 1: SWAP Symmetry (Phase 108)

```
SWAP: S: (I, Pi) -> (Pi, I)
S^2 = Identity
This is a discrete Z_2 symmetry.
```

### Step 2: Covering Group (Phase 110)

```
In quantum mechanics, we need PROJECTIVE representations.
Z_2 has covering group SU(2).

Z_2 (discrete) -> SU(2) (continuous)

This is why spin-1/2 particles exist!
```

### Step 3: Pauli Matrices

```
SU(2) generators are Pauli matrices:
    sigma_x = SWAP matrix!
    sigma_y, sigma_z = other generators

These satisfy: {sigma_i, sigma_j} = 2*delta_ij (anticommutation)

Spin-1/2 = fundamental representation of SU(2).
```

### Step 4: Relativity Requirement

```
Special Relativity: E^2 = p^2*c^2 + m^2*c^4

Problem: Quantum mechanics needs FIRST-ORDER time derivative.
Klein-Gordon has second-order -> negative probabilities!

Dirac's insight: LINEARIZE the equation.
Ansatz: E = alpha_i*p_i + beta*m

Squaring gives E^2 = p^2 + m^2 IF:
    {alpha_i, alpha_j} = 2*delta_ij
    {alpha_i, beta} = 0
    beta^2 = I
```

### Step 5: Clifford Algebra

```
The anticommutation relations define CLIFFORD ALGEBRA Cl(3,1).

Minimum dimension: 4x4 matrices.

Gamma matrices: {gamma^mu, gamma^nu} = 2*eta^{mu,nu}
where eta = diag(1, -1, -1, -1) is Minkowski metric.
```

### Step 6: Tensor Product Structure

```
The 4x4 structure comes from TENSOR PRODUCT:

    Coordination Phase Space (I, Pi):
    - sigma: Internal spin structure (from SWAP)
    - tau: Particle/antiparticle (from energy sign)

    Dirac matrices = sigma (tensor) tau

This gives 2 x 2 = 4 components:
    - 2 spin states (up/down from I vs Pi)
    - 2 matter states (particle/antiparticle)
```

### Step 7: The Dirac Equation

```
(i * gamma^mu * partial_mu - m) * psi = 0

Hamiltonian form:
    H = alpha . p + beta * m

VERIFIED: Squares to Klein-Gordon equation.
UNIQUE: Only first-order relativistic equation for spin-1/2.
```

## Derived Consequences

### 1. Antimatter Existence

```
The Dirac equation has FOUR solutions:
    E = +sqrt(p^2 + m^2)  [2 spin states - particle]
    E = -sqrt(p^2 + m^2)  [2 spin states - antiparticle]

Negative energy reinterpreted as:
    Positive energy with opposite charge = ANTIPARTICLE

PREDICTION: Positron (anti-electron)
    Predicted by Dirac: 1928
    Discovered by Anderson: 1932

ANTIMATTER IS DERIVED FROM COORDINATION STRUCTURE!
```

### 2. CPT Symmetry

```
C (Charge conjugation): particle <-> antiparticle
P (Parity): x -> -x
T (Time reversal): t -> -t

Individual symmetries:
    T: BROKEN in coordination (Phase 111)
    P: VIOLATED in weak interactions
    C: VIOLATED in weak interactions

Combined CPT: ALWAYS CONSERVED

WHY? The tensor product structure + Lorentz invariance
     GUARANTEES CPT invariance.

CPT IS DERIVED FROM COORDINATION!
```

### 3. Electron g-factor = 2

```
Magnetic moment: mu = g * (e/2m) * S

Classical prediction: g = 1
Dirac equation prediction: g = 2 EXACTLY

Why g = 2 from coordination:
    - Spin from SWAP (Z_2 -> SU(2))
    - Spinor transforms under BOTH Lorentz AND spin
    - These combine to give extra factor of 2

Experimental:
    Dirac: g = 2.000000...
    Measured: g = 2.00231930436256

The anomaly (g-2)/2 = 0.00116 is explained by QED corrections.
The BASIC g = 2 is from Dirac equation, derived from coordination!

## Connections to Earlier Phases

### Phase 108: SWAP Symmetry
```
Phase 108 discovered S: (I, Pi) -> (Pi, I).
Phase 112 shows this SWAP directly leads to Dirac equation!
SWAP -> Z_2 -> SU(2) -> Pauli -> Clifford -> Dirac
```

### Phase 110: Full QM Derivation
```
Phase 110 derived Schrodinger equation and spin-1/2.
Phase 112 extends to RELATIVISTIC quantum mechanics.
Same SWAP symmetry, now with Lorentz invariance.
```

### Phase 111: Arrow of Time
```
Phase 111 showed T, P, PT are broken individually.
Phase 112 shows CPT is still conserved!
The tensor product structure protects CPT.
```

### Phase 107: Hamiltonian Dynamics
```
Phase 107: H(I, Pi) = alpha*I + beta*Pi
Phase 112: H_Dirac = alpha.p + beta*m

Same Hamiltonian structure, now relativistic!
The Master Equation extends to Dirac domain.
```

## New Questions Opened (Q489-Q495)

### Q489: Full QED Lagrangian from coordination?
**Priority**: HIGH | **Tractability**: MEDIUM

Dirac equation couples to A_mu. Can we derive the full QED Lagrangian
(Dirac + Maxwell + interaction) from coordination principles?

### Q490: Neutrino masses from coordination?
**Priority**: HIGH | **Tractability**: LOW

Dirac neutrinos vs Majorana neutrinos. Does coordination prefer one?

### Q491: Weak SU(2) from SWAP extension?
**Priority**: VERY HIGH | **Tractability**: MEDIUM

SWAP gives SU(2) for spin. Does the SAME SU(2) underlie weak force?
Would unify spin and weak interaction!

### Q492: Chirality interpretation?
**Priority**: HIGH | **Tractability**: MEDIUM

Dirac spinor has left-handed and right-handed parts.
Why does weak force only couple to left-handed?
What is the coordination meaning?

### Q493: Three fermion generations?
**Priority**: VERY HIGH | **Tractability**: LOW

Why exactly 3 generations (e, mu, tau)?
Is there a coordination structure that gives 3?

### Q494: Dirac sea interpretation?
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Tractability**: MEDIUM

What is the Dirac sea in coordination phase space?

### Q495: Pauli exclusion from SWAP?
**Priority**: HIGH | **Tractability**: HIGH

Fermions obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.
Is this from SWAP symmetry structure?
