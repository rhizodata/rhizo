## Summary

### Cross-Table ACID (Implemented)

The foundational paper describing how Rhizo achieves multi-table ACID transactions without a coordination service. Key contributions:
- Content-addressable storage with BLAKE3 hashing
- O(t) complexity for t-table transactions
- Zero-copy branching via pointer manipulation
- 1,500+ MB/s write throughput on commodity hardware

### ACID Without Consensus (Implemented)

Describes how algebraic operation classification enables coordination-free distributed transactions. Key contributions:
- Operations classified by algebraic structure (semilattice, Abelian group)
- Local commits for algebraically conflict-free operations
- 31,000x latency improvement vs consensus baseline
- 97,943x energy reduction for algebraic workloads

### POAC (Research)

Explores probabilistic techniques for further performance optimization. Experimental techniques:
- Bloom filter write-sets for O(1) conflict detection
- Speculative execution for low-conflict workloads
- Escrow transactions for hot spot scalability
